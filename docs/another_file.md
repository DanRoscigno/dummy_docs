# What is W&B?

W&B is the machine learning platform for developers to build better models faster. Use W&B's lightweight, interoperable tools to quickly track experiments, version and iterate on datasets, evaluate model performance, reproduce models, visualize results and spot regressions, and share findings with colleagues.
Set up W&B in 5 minutes, then quickly iterate on your machine learning pipeline with the confidence that your datasets and models are tracked and versioned in a reliable system of record.

## Are you a first-time user of W&B?

If this is your first time using W&B we suggest you explore the following:

1. Experience W&B in action, [run an example introduction project with Google Colab](http://wandb.me/intro).
1. Read through the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md) for a quick overview of how and where to add W&B to your code.
1. Read [How does W&B work?](#how-does-weights--biases-work) This section provides an overview of the building blocks of W&B.
1. Explore our [Integrations guide](./integrations/intro.md) and our [W&B Easy Integration YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD80i8An1OEGDADxOBaH71ZwieZ9nmPGC) playlist for information on how to integrate W&B with your preferred machine learning framework.
1. View the [API Reference guide](../ref/README.md) for technical specifications about the W&B Python Library, CLI, and Weave operations.
